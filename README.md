# deprecated-grpc-naming

This is a copy of the `google.golang.org/grpc/naming` dependency at tag `v1.29.1`.  It was removed in https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/pull/3314 in favor of the [resolver](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc@v1.30.0/resolver) package.  If at all possible, you should use that instead.

This repository is unmaintained.
